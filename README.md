# Initial Setup
1. setup & activate a python venv if you haven't already
2. Begin by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the root directory to install all dependencies. 

# Database Setup
1. enter backendsrc directory and run <code>python manage.py migrate</code>
2. run <code>python manage.py runserver</code>
3. good to go! (username and password are 'root' if you wish to access the admin panel)

# How to update the structure of the database
1. <code>python manage.py showmigrations</code>. This lists the current migrations.
2. <code>python manage.py makemigrations</code>. This creates a new autogenerated migration file according to the updated schema.
3. <code>python manage.py migrate</code>. This applies a migration which is currently unapplied (updates the database)

(https://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/quickstart/)

FYI: If db changes have been made and you are unable to apply any new migrations just run makemigrations, this will generate any neccecary migrations, and then these can be applied. This problem will occur if someone updates the db structure without generating and commiting new migrations for their changes. Another way to do this is just delete the files in ./db/migrations that are numbered (0001_... etc) and you should be able to remigrate. This might happen now and again to to multiple people edited the db and forgetting to migrate before pushing each time (you ).

# Frontend Setup 
1. ensure you have Node version 18 installed check using
```shell
node -v
```

2. In the root directory, run the following command to run the frontend installer
```bash
cat frontend-setup.sh | bash
```
If you see a `permission denied` error, run:
```bash
chmod +x install.sh
```
to give the script execution permissions, then try running the script again.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

# Local Viewing
In order to test locally with the frontend and backend communicating simply run both commands in separate terminal windows to run the backend and frontend local servers, and navigate to the frontend at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. Since the backend server is also running it will communicate with the frontend locally.
